# IntroducingGoWorkbook
_Introducing Go_ is a book I bought off the O'Reilly online bookstore. 

The ebook is only 124 pages long.  Since this is a short book and I have been programming for almost 20 years in as many languages, I'm doing a chapter every day. The first day, I worked through the first four chapters.  These chapters were very similar to most other languages.  Arrays are slightly different so I devoted an entire afternoon to memorizing them.


Folders will be seperated based on chapters.  I'm using the pomodoro aproach to learning and logging my thoughts/progress on my tablet cloud spreadsheet.

Chapters are as follows
1) Getting Started
2) Types
3) Variables
4) Control Statements
5) Arrays
6) Functions
7) Structs
8) Packages
9) Testing
10) Concurrency
11) Next steps

As you can see this is basic.  For a more indepth foray, I have purchased **_Go In Action_** for my next read.

from there, I intend to buy and read _Go in Practice_
