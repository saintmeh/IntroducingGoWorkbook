# IntroducingGoWorkbook
_Introducing Go_ is a book I bought off the O'Reilly online bookstore. 

It's a basic book for new programmers, but I won't let that deter me. 

The ebook is only 124 pages long.  I hope to get through most of it today.

Folders will be seperated based on chapters.  I'm using the pomodoro aproach to learning and logging my thoughts/progress on my tablet cloud spreadsheet.

Chapters are as follows
1) Getting Started
2) Types
3) Variables
4) Control Statements
5) Arrays
6) Functions
7) Structs
8) Packages
9) Testing
10) Concurrency
11) Next steps

As you can see this is basic.  For a more indepth foray, I have downloaded **_Go In Action_**

I've researched these books as if I would teach a class from them.  I am very pleased with what _Go In Action_ has to offer

I also intend to buy and read _Go in Practice_
